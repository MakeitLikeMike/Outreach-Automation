Quality Review:
Used for final QA pass before email is sent, or integrated into Claude’s classification logic.
   * Site has a contact page with email or form (e.g., info@domain.com)

   * Site topic is relevant or adjacent to casino, finance, entertainment, etc.

   * Post appears in the main blog/feed (not buried or hidden)

   * Editorial backlinks on first 1–2 pages of backlink report

   * Anchor texts look natural, not spammy or keyword-stuffed

   * Other blog content is high-quality and not spun or AI junk

   * Traffic is niche-relevant (not irrelevant junk traffic)

   * Site ranks for keywords related to your niche

   * DR-to-traffic ratio is natural (e.g., DR 50 should have ~10k+ traffic)
